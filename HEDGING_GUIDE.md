# Comprehensive Hedging Guide

## 📚 **What is Hedging?**

Hedging is the linguistic technique of making statements **less absolute** and **more nuanced**. It's how humans naturally express uncertainty, probability, or avoid making overly strong claims.

### **Why AI Text Needs Hedging:**

- ❌ AI text is too definitive and absolute
- ❌ Sounds robotic and overconfident
- ❌ Not academically appropriate
- ❌ Ignores exceptions and variability

### **Benefits of Hedging:**

- ✅ Sounds more natural and human-like
- ✅ More academically appropriate
- ✅ Acknowledges limitations and uncertainty
- ✅ Less prone to being factually wrong
- ✅ More persuasive in academic contexts

## 🎭 **Five Hedging Strategies**

Our system uses **5 different strategies**, each targeting specific linguistic patterns:

### **Strategy 1: Modal Verb Replacement (30%)**

**Purpose:** Replace strong, absolute verbs with hedged versions

**Replacements:**
| Strong Verb | Hedged Alternatives |
|-------------|---------------------|
| proves | suggests, indicates, may prove, appears to prove |
| demonstrates | suggests, indicates, seems to demonstrate |
| shows | suggests, indicates, appears to show, tends to show |
| confirms | supports, suggests, may confirm |
| guarantees | may ensure, likely ensures, tends to ensure |
| ensures | may ensure, helps ensure, can ensure |
| is/are | may be, could be, might be, appears to be |
| will | may, might, could, would likely |
| causes | may cause, can cause, tends to cause |
| solves | may solve, can help solve, tends to solve |

**Examples:**

```
Before: "AI proves that automation is effective."
After: "AI suggests that automation is effective."

Before: "This demonstrates superiority."
After: "This indicates superiority."

Before: "Data shows clear trends."
After: "Data appears to show clear trends."

Before: "AI will transform industries."
After: "AI might transform industries."

Before: "This guarantees success."
After: "This may ensure success."
```

---

### **Strategy 2: Frequency Adverbs (25%)**

**Purpose:** Add frequency adverbs before main verbs

**Process:**

1. Identify main verb in sentence
2. Check if it already has a frequency adverb
3. If not, insert one from the frequency list

**Examples:**

```
Before: "AI improves decision-making."
After: "AI typically improves decision-making."

Before: "Machine learning identifies patterns."
After: "Machine learning frequently identifies patterns."

Before: "The algorithm produces accurate results."
After: "The algorithm usually produces accurate results."

Before: "Neural networks learn from data."
After: "Neural networks generally learn from data."
```

---

### **Strategy 3: Approximators for Adjectives (20%)**

**Purpose:** Add degree modifiers before strong adjectives

**Target Adjectives:**

```
significant, important, critical, essential, crucial, vital, key,
major, substantial, considerable, dramatic, remarkable, notable,
exceptional, outstanding, definite, certain, absolute, complete,
total, perfect, ideal, optimal, superior, excellent
```

**Examples:**

```
Before: "This is a significant improvement."
After: "This is a relatively significant improvement."

Before: "Results show important findings."
After: "Results show fairly important findings."

Before: "The impact is substantial."
After: "The impact is rather substantial."

Before: "This represents a perfect solution."
After: "This represents a reasonably optimal solution."

Before: "The method is superior."
After: "The method is comparatively superior."
```

---

### **Strategy 4: Epistemic Stance Markers (15%)**

**Purpose:** Add epistemic markers to express uncertainty about knowledge

**Process:**

1. Find main verb
2. Add epistemic marker before it
3. Adjust verb form if necessary (e.g., "appears to + base form")

**Examples:**

```
Before: "AI solves complex problems."
After: "AI appears to solve complex problems."

Before: "This method works effectively."
After: "This method seems to work effectively."

Before: "The system improves accuracy."
After: "The system tends to improve accuracy."

Before: "Results confirm the hypothesis."
After: "Results are likely to confirm the hypothesis."

Before: "The algorithm optimizes performance."
After: "The algorithm is believed to optimize performance."
```

---

### **Strategy 5: Scope Limiters (10%)**

**Purpose:** Add limiting phrases at the beginning of sentences

**Process:**

1. Check if sentence already starts with a hedge/transition
2. If not, prepend a scope limiter
3. Lowercase the original first word

**Examples:**

```
Before: "AI is effective for data analysis."
After: "In most cases, AI is effective for data analysis."

Before: "This approach outperforms alternatives."
After: "To a large extent, this approach outperforms alternatives."

Before: "Neural networks achieve high accuracy."
After: "In general, neural networks achieve high accuracy."

Before: "The methodology produces reliable results."
After: "For the most part, the methodology produces reliable results."

Before: "Machine learning algorithms are superior."
After: "By and large, machine learning algorithms are superior."
```

## 📊 **Complete Examples**

### **Example 1: Research Paper Tone**

**Original (AI-generated, too absolute):**

```
The study proves that machine learning algorithms improve
diagnostic accuracy. The results show significant improvements
in all cases. AI is the perfect solution for medical imaging.
This approach will revolutionize healthcare.
```

**After Hedging:**

```
The study suggests that machine learning algorithms generally
improve diagnostic accuracy. The results appear to show fairly
significant improvements in most cases. AI may be a reasonably
optimal solution for medical imaging. This approach might
potentially revolutionize healthcare.
```

---

### **Example 2: Technical Documentation**

**Original:**

```
The algorithm guarantees optimal performance. It solves all
edge cases and eliminates errors. This is a perfect implementation
that demonstrates superior efficiency.
```

**After Hedging:**

```
The algorithm tends to ensure optimal performance. It appears
to solve many edge cases and largely eliminates errors. This is
a reasonably sound implementation that suggests superior efficiency.
```

---

### **Example 3: Academic Abstract**

**Original:**

```
AI transforms educational outcomes. The technology proves
effectiveness in every scenario. Results confirm that automation
is the definite answer. This establishes a new paradigm.
```

**After Hedging:**

```
AI appears to transform educational outcomes. The technology
suggests effectiveness in many scenarios. Results tend to confirm
that automation may be a viable answer. This potentially establishes
a new paradigm.
```

## 🔍 **Smart Features**

### **1. Avoids Double Hedging**

```
✅ "AI generally improves outcomes"
❌ "AI generally typically usually improves outcomes" (too much!)
```

The system detects existing hedges and won't add more.

### **2. Context-Aware Placement**

```
✅ "AI appears to solve problems"
❌ "AI to appears solve problems" (wrong placement!)
```

Uses spaCy POS tagging to place hedges correctly.

### **3. Grammar-Aware Transformations**

```
✅ "Results tend to show" (correct verb form)
❌ "Results tend to shows" (wrong!)
```

Adjusts verb forms when needed (base form after "to").

### **4. Respects Existing Qualifiers**

```
Input: "AI already often improves outcomes"
Output: "AI already often improves outcomes" (no change - already hedged)
```

## 📈 **Hedging Statistics**

When you run hedging at **p_hedge=0.15** (default) on a typical text:

- **~15% of sentences** get hedged
- **Distribution:**
  - 30% modal verb replacements
  - 25% frequency adverbs
  - 20% approximators
  - 15% epistemic markers
  - 10% scope limiters

**Example:** In a 100-sentence document:

- ~15 sentences will be hedged
- ~5 will get modal replacement
- ~4 will get frequency adverbs
- ~3 will get approximators
- ~2 will get epistemic markers
- ~1 will get scope limiter

---

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **DO:**

✅ Use moderate hedging (0.15-0.25) for academic writing
✅ Increase hedging for exploratory/preliminary research
✅ Hedge strong claims ("proves", "guarantees", "always")
✅ Combine with other humanization features

### **DON'T:**

❌ Over-hedge (> 0.5) - text becomes too weak
❌ Hedge factual statements ("2 + 2 = 4" doesn't need hedging)
❌ Hedge citations or quotes
❌ Use maximum hedging for confident findings
